# Docker Sapphire Bot example

This is a basic setup of a Discord bot using the [sapphire framework][sapphire] written in TypeScript containerized with Docker

## How to use it?

### Prerequisite

Copy the `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`, make sure to fill the Token

### Development

Run `docker-compose up`. This will start the bot in watch mode and automatically run it after each save.
It will build the `Dockerfile` up untill the `development` stage.

### Production

Just like in the development step, you have to fill in the `.env` file and then run the following command to create a production image;

```sh
docker build . -t sapphire-sample-bot
```

To test if your image works, you can run:

```sh
docker run --env-file .env sapphire-sample-bot
```
