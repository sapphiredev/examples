# Javascript Sapphire V1 Bot example

This is a basic setup of a Discord bot using the [sapphire framework (V1)][sapphire] written in Javascript

## How to use it?

### Prerequisite

```sh
npm install
```

### Development

This example can be run with `nodemon` to watch the files and automatically restart your bot.

```sh
npm run watch
```

### Production

You can also run the bot with `npm start`, this will simply do a `node ./src/sample-bot.js`. But this is not the recommended way to run a bot in production.
